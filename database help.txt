getting the passengers/flights table

getting the non passengers
SELECT a.fname, a.lname
FROM flights_passengers as fp 
JOIN passengers AS a ON a.id <> fp.passenger_id
JOIN flights AS f ON fp.flight_id = f.id
JOIN airport AS b ON f.origin = b.id
JOIN airport AS c ON f.destination = c.id
WHERE f.id = 1


SELECT a.fname, a.lname, b.code,b.city, c.code,c.city 
FROM flights_passengers as fp 
JOIN passengers AS a ON a.id = fp.passenger_id
JOIN flights AS f ON f.id = fp.flight_id;
JOIN airport AS b ON f.origin = b.id
JOIN airport AS c ON f.destination = c.id

SELECT a.fname, a.lname
FROM flights_passengers as fp 
JOIN passengers AS a ON a.id = fp.passenger_id
JOIN flights AS f ON fp.flight_id = f.id
JOIN airport AS b ON f.origin = b.id
JOIN airport AS c ON f.destination = c.id

using the same table twice

SELECT a.id, a.duration, b1.city, b1.code, b2.city, b2.code
FROM flights a
JOIN airport b1 ON b1.id = a.origin
JOIN airport b2 ON b2.id = a.destination


SELECT flights.id, flights.duration, airport.code, airport.city, flights.destination
FROM flights, airport 
WHERE flights.origin = airport.id 

SELECT flights.id, flights.duration, airport.code, airport.city FROM flights 
INNER JOIN airport


php will solve this problem "easily"
